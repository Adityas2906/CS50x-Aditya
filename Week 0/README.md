# 🏀 Ball Bounce Game — CS50x Project 0

This is a simple yet interactive **ball bounce game** built in **Scratch**, fulfilling all the core requirements for **CS50x Week 0 Project**.

## 🎮 Game Description

The game features:
- A bouncing ball
- A player-controlled paddle (via mouse)
- A counter for successful bounces
- A game over state if the ball misses the paddle
- A restart button to replay the game

Players must keep the ball from falling off the screen by moving the paddle to bounce it back. The bounce count increases with each successful bounce. When the ball falls below the paddle, the game ends and displays the final score. A "Play Again" button allows the game to restart.
