## What is Programming?

Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform tasks.  
Itâ€™s like writing a recipe â€” step-by-step instructions with inputs and outputs.

- **Input:** What we give to the computer (e.g., click, type)
- **Output:** What the computer gives back (e.g., text, sound)

## What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is writing logic in plain English before converting it into real code.

**Example:**

If hungry:
Eat
Else:
Sleep

## Scratch

- A visual programming language using blocks
- Helped me understand logic, conditions, loops without worrying about syntax
- Fun to build projects like animations, games, or quizzes

## Reflection

I enjoyed learning how logic works in computers.  
Using Scratch was fun and helped me understand programming concepts clearly.  
Now I'm feeling ready to start coding in C from Week 1.
